# Swarm Robots - Deep Learning

Explore the application of Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques to Swarm Robotics, focusing on defining neural network architectures and suitable communication patterns that can enhance the performance of the swarm in Search and Rescue settings. 

## Training 

To train with PPO...

Our models are trained using the following settings: [ReportSettings](config/OurConfig/ReportSettings.yaml)

## Test 

In order to Test your models, attach your model to the Test prefab, build the unity enviroment with the 4 test scene and run it. Make sure that the built environment is located in a folder inside `BuiltEnvs`.

## Graphs

In [OurModels](OurModels/) folder you can find useful python scripts to plot the data obtained during the tests.
